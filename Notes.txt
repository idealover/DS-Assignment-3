- Design Decision: Producers can publish to specific partitions 
- Consumers can subscribe to a specific topic and we will give the output based on the time when the message has been published 
- Please complete views.py file and the rest of the functions in redirector.py 
- Two important functions that can be left for later are add_broker and delete_broker. 
- Another choice that has to be made is the url pattern for which the producer can produce to a specific pattern 
- And when a new partition has been created, a new design decision is which broker handles it(I am thinking of creating a new broker in case the latest broker has more than average numeber of partitions)
